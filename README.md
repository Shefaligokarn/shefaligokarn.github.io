# AI Projects

## Project 1: Sentiment Analysis using TensorFlow

![Sentiment Analysis](images/sentiment-analysis.png)

In this project, I developed a sentiment analysis model using TensorFlow. The model was trained on a dataset of movie reviews and achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test data. I used techniques such as pre-processing, word embeddings, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture.

- **Tools:** TensorFlow, Python, Natural Language Processing

For this project, I built an image classification model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The model was trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset and achieved a top-1 accuracy of 92%. I used data augmentation, various CNN layers, and regularization techniques to enhance the model's performance.

- **Tools:** PyTorch, Python, Deep Learning

In this project, I created a chatbot using a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture with attention mechanisms. The chatbot was trained on dialogue datasets and demonstrated the ability to generate meaningful responses. I used beam search for response generation and evaluated the chatbot's performance through interactive sessions.
